===== GENERAL

- 2 functions
  - Estimate, a light non-recursive function made to evaluate the positivity of a situation ; 0 is certain death, 1 is certain win
  - Choose, a deep recursive choosing function, which will traverse the turn possibilities to find the best one ; at its leaves, it will use Estimate

===== ESTIMATE

=== GENERAL

- Returns a float between 0 and 1
- Returns 0 if certain death
- Returns 1 if certain win

=== V0

- Returns 0 if the game is lost
- Returns 1 if the game is won
- Returns 0.5 in any other case

===== CHOOSE

- Returns a class containing the TurnResponse and the positivity
- If the critical time (default = Max(9/10 of the given time, 150 milliseconds)) is not reached, continues the traversal
- If the critical time is reached, checks all the possibilities with the Estimate function, and returns the best TurnResponse with a positivity found with Estimate

=== V1

- If the critical time is not reached
  - Builds all the possible turns
  - Recursive call on all the possibilities ; finds the least positive possibility (as it is the other player's turn), and returns its turn with, as a positivity, the average between all the
    reversed positivities found with the recursive calls
- If the vritical time is reached
  - Builds all the possible turns
  - Estimates the positivities of all the turns and returns the least positive, with the average of all the reversed positivities as a positivity
